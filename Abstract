# Enhancing-File-Transfer-Protocol-Using-Server-Networks
In the digital era, secure file transfer is paramount to maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of data across server networks. This project explores the enhancement of file transfer security using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm known for its robustness and effectiveness in secure data transmission. We investigate the current challenges in secure file transfers, including vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that threaten data security. Through a comprehensive analysis and implementation of advanced cryptographic techniques, we aim to fortify the security framework, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Our methodology encompasses a series of simulated network environments to test the robustness of various security enhancements. The results indicate a significant improvement in security measures without compromising the efficiency of file transfers. This study contributes to the field by providing a detailed assessment of AES-based security enhancements and offering a practical approach to safeguarding sensitive information in serverÂ networks.
